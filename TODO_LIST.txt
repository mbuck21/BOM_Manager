# TODO

Last Updated: 2026-02-11

## Now
- [ ] New interactive dashboard layout
  - Left side (about 1/3 width): root + first-level children view (table is fine if graph is too heavy)
  - Click a child row/node to make that part the new root and refresh view
  - Right side: weight rollup breakdown for children of current root
  - Show: part number, name, qty, effective weight, maturity-added weight
  - Show total weight on screen
  - Add pie chart for contribution breakdown

## Next
- [ ] Category breakdowns
  - Add/support category attribute on parts (examples: Structure, Electrical, etc.)
  - Build weight breakdown by category
  - Option to hide non-selected categories or roll them into `Other`

- [ ] Saveable breakdowns
  - Create and save custom breakdown definitions/views
  - Allow adding independent (manually selected) parts to a breakdown

- [ ] Weight reduction eligibility flag
  - Add boolean part attribute for reduction eligibility (for example `is_weight_reducible`)
  - Use it in reduction-opportunity views/filters so only eligible parts are considered

## Later
- [ ] Add charts/filters polish once core flows above are working

## Done
- [x] Added weight rollup with unit-weight override + maturity factor in backend
- [x] Added Streamlit Weight Analysis tab
